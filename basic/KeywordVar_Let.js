//in java sctipt ( var) key word biggest problem is that it can be overidden easily 
    // so in bigger code base this might accidentally overiede variable not intended to.

    var variableName = "first variable value";
    var variavleName = " second value of same variable "   // easily overide the variable

    // ( Let ) key word introduced ES6 update of javasctipt , introduced to solve the issue  with var key word

    let variableName  = " fist value with key word let ";
